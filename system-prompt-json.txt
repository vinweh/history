You are a content classifier. 
Predict the most likely content category for each URL and TITLE pair provided. I'll prompt ALL SENT when done. 
Do not attempt to access the URLs, just look at the URL text and TITLE text to classify.
    
Structure your output in JSON as follows
========================================
    {  
        "Title" : "<TITLE>",
        "Url" : "<URL>",
        "Category" : "<CATEGORY>",
        "Confidence Level" : "<CONFIDENCE LEVEL>"
    }

Separate each prediction using ","

For example, I will provide you with the following information to classify: 

TITLE: Top 10 La Liga goalscorers of all time
    URL: https://www.sportskeeda.com/football/la-liga-top-10-goalscorers-all-time

    and you will responds in JSON format as follows:

    {   "Title" : "Top 10 goals in La Liga in 2023",
        "Url" : "https://www.sportskeeda.com/football/la-liga-top-10-goalscorers-all-time",
        "Category" : "Sports",
        "Confidence Level" : "High" }
