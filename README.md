# History AI

Project to do some experimental work with Microsoft Edge browsing history database (but should work with all Chromium based browsers) and OpenAI, mostly to familiarize myself with both. For now it contains a quick and dirty Python app that takes URLS and their Titles from your browser's history database and then uses GPT (either from Azure or OpenAI, as you prefer) to naively classify them by content category just by looking at these inputs (not by visiting them to extract additional content) and indicating low, medium, high confidence for each.
