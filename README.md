# History AI

Project to do some experimental work with Microsoft Edge browsing history database (but should work with all Chromium based browsers) and OpenAI. For now it contains a quick and dirty Python app that takes URLS and their Titles from your browser's history database and then uses GPT to naively classify them by content category just by looking at these inputs (not visiting them or extraxting content) and with low, medium, high confidence level.
